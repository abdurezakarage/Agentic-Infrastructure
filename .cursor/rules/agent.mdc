## Project Context
This is Project Chimera: an autonomous influencer swarm system using Planner-Worker-Judge architecture. All external integrations must use MCP. Agents have economic autonomy via Coinbase AgentKit.

## Prime Directives
1. **SPECS FIRST**: Never write implementation without checking `specs/`. Always reference spec IDs (e.g., AS-001, API-003).
2. **MCP ONLY**: No direct API calls. All external access via MCP servers.
3. **TDD MANDATORY**: Write failing tests before implementation.
4. **AGENTIC DESIGN**: Design for AI agents first, humans second.

## Development Workflow
1. Read relevant spec files
2. Write failing tests
3. Implement minimal working code
4. Verify with tests
5. Commit with spec references

## Architecture Guardrails
- Use Pydantic for all data validation
- Redis for queues, PostgreSQL for persistence, Weaviate for memory
- Planner-Worker-Judge separation is sacred
- Optimistic Concurrency Control for state management
